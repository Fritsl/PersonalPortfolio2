Build me a personal website with the following requirements:

Goal:
Create a personal profile website that looks and feels like a Wikipedia article. The design should be clean, boring, neutral, and factual — not flashy or promotional. It should reflect the diversity and breadth of my achievements across different fields, without turning into a chronological resume.

Tone and Style:

    Neutral, objective, third-person tone.

    No marketing language, no exaggerations, no personal branding.

    Conservative typography (like Wikipedia or a plain newspaper site).

    White or light background, black or dark gray text.

    No animations, no dynamic effects, no bright colors.

Structure:

    A short neutral introduction about me.

    A table of contents for easy navigation.

    Sections organized by type of achievement (not by year).

    Each section contains bullet points or short paragraphs, each describing an achievement.

    Use external links where relevant (e.g., to publications, communities, media mentions).

    Headings and subheadings for scannability.

Editing and Maintenance:

    Each achievement or point should be written modularly, so I can easily add, edit, or expand new entries without breaking the layout.

    New sections should be easy to add later.
