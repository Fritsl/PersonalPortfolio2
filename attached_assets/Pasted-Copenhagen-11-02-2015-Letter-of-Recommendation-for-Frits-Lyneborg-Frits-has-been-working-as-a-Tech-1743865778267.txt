Letter of Recommendation for Frits Lyneborg

Frits has been working as a Technical Art Director at PortaPlay ApS during the fall, winter, and spring of 2014/2015, on the project Tales from the Void.

Frits was originally hired as a gameplay scripter/designer due to his previous experience in concept development and technical development of general IT projects, as well as his skills in Playmaker, scripting, and the creation of advanced technical setups for gameplay creation (e.g., automated level creation using splines and scripts). This role was assigned based on his CV and track record, which, despite a seemingly short period of experience in game development, demonstrated strong expertise in gameplay scripting.

After the start of his employment, we discovered that Frits is a very talented Technical Art Director. He is both highly technically skilled and deeply focused on aesthetics, quality, performance, and workflow. This led us to change his role to Technical Art Director, where he was responsible for significantly increasing the project's quality, both in terms of visuals and overall game performance.

In practice, he primarily worked on:

    Modeling, texturing, mapping, skinning, and rigging

    Rendering, shaders, particle effects, lighting, baking, and quality settings

    Implementing visual effects in scenes, such as skyboxes, weather effects, explosions, backdrops, etc.

    Performance optimization, workflow planning, and directing 3D artists

While this list covers many areas, especially for someone with relatively short experience in game development, it is important to highlight one of Frits' key strengths: he is an incredibly fast learner and quickly masters technical areas of expertise.

Frits’ personal initiative and drive also mean that he is very capable of working independently within a defined vision. His initiative is closely tied to his strong motivation and clear opinions—sometimes outspoken—but he has no problem working in directions he may not fully agree with.

We are very satisfied with Frits’ efforts and would have liked to retain him permanently. The only reason we did not was due to the nature of upcoming projects in our pipeline.

Finally, we believe that Frits is a wonderful addition to any team. He fit right in, contributed to a good atmosphere at lunch and social events, was always willing to lend a helping hand, and remained focused on solving challenges as they arose.

In other words — I can very strongly recommend Frits.

With regards,
Creative Director Hans von Knut Skovfoged
